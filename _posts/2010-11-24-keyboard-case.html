<p>I use a <a href="http://www.kinesis-ergo.com/advantage.htm">Kinesis Advantage USB</a> ergonomic keyboard. For the last two years and a bit, I've been carrying the keyboard to and from work every day.  My only travel case has been the original Kinesis packaging material, reinforced by duct tape, coffee stains, and the rain:</p>

<p>Worst of all, I often travel to customer sites. When I'm on a customer site, I typically use the Kinesis box as a laptop stand. This has not helped the pronounced sag in the cardboard.</p>

<p>I've wanted a hard-sided case for the keyboard since the first time I spilled coffee on the original box.  The Kinesis is too wide and too tall for any standard laptop case. I looked into briefcases, but hard-sided briefcases are <i>very</i> expensive, $300-$500.  "Halliburton"-style cases are about the same.  Lastly, Googling "Kinesis keyboard case" didn't get me anywhere.  That is why this blog post exists at all -- I don't want the next traveling Kinesis user to wait as long as I did before buying an appropriate travel case.</p>

<p>The solution I settled on is a <a href="http://www.seahorse.net">Seahorse</a> equipment case, the <a href="http://www.seahorse.net/Products/hurricane/SE720/SE720.aspx">SE-720</a>.  It's much like a Pelican case, but less expensive.  At about $80 shipped, it's <i>much</i> less expensive than the Halliburton or briefcase alternatives. Seahorse recommends their products for firearms, fragile DSLRs, etc.  Now that I have the case in hand, I can see why.  The foam fillers are reasonably sturdy, and the case itself is built like a tank.  It seems like it should be a murder weapon in Clue.  (The Colonel, in the saloon, with the keyboard case!)</p>

<p>The foam filler is a key advantage to an equipment case over a standard laptop case.  It's pre-scored top-to-bottom, sort of like perforated paper:</p>

<p>I was able to create the cavities for the keyboard and cord with just a butter knife to help out.  <a href="http://www.fuertecases.com">Fuerte Cases</a>, a Seahorse distributor, has a <a href="http://www.fuertecases.com/helpful-hints.html#foam">hints page</a> that explains in detail.  It took me about 30 minutes to turn the pre-scored foam into a custom insert for the keyboard.</p>

<p>The SE-720 is rather bulky, a little smaller than a typewriter.  Surprisingly, after the foam inserts, there's only about 1.5" of extra vertical space over the keyboard.  Since the next size down, the SE-710, is about 2" smaller, I don't think it would fit.</p>

<p>2015 update: I ended up buying a SE-710 a few years ago, to replace the 720.  It's less bulky, it bangs against my knee less while carrying it, and the keyboard fits just as well.</p>
